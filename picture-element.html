        Abstract
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <code>picture</code> element gives authors a way to control which
        image resource the user agent presents to a user based on a media query
        and/or support for a particular image format.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary purpose of the <code>picture</code> element is to address
        use cases that are left unaddressed by the <code>srcset</code>
        attribute; the most important being <q><a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#art-direction">art
        direction</a></q>. Other use cases, such as <q><a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#matching-media-features-and-media-types">
        matching media features and media types</a></q> and matching on
        supported <q><a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#image-formats">image
        formats</a></q>, are also addressed by this specification.

    <p>
      In interactive visual media, if support for images has been enabled, the
      picture element represents an image.
    </p>
    <p>
      In non-visual media, and in visual media if images have been disabled,
      the picture element represents its fallback content instead.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      This allows implementations to render broken <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>
      in the same way as broken <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> without complexity of
      dynamically exposing full fallback content.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Controlling image
    </h3>
    <p>
      This specification defines behavior of the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>
      element in terms of controlling an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element
      displayed in its place. When the specification refers to controlling
      image element, user agents should perform steps as defined for the
      <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. The controlling image element should
      not be exposed in DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events that are fired on the controlling image must be fired on the
      picture element.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      This is intended to allow user agents to implement
      <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> via <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> in shadow DOM
      or reuse of most of <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element's implementation.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Attributes
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>src</code>, <code>srcset</code>, <code>width</code>,
      <code>height</code> and <code>complete</code> IDL attributes must return
      value of the corresponding IDL attribute of the controlling image.
    </p>
    <p>
      On setting the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes must
      act as if they reflected the respective content attributes of the
      <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element and immediately run the source
      selection algorithm starting from step 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <code>src</code> or <code>srcset</code> IDL attribute is set:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the <code>src</code>/<code>srcset</code> IDL attribute
      (respectively) of the controlling image is equal to the value being set,
      then abort these steps.
      </li>
      <li>Remove all <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> children of the picture
      element.
      </li>
      <li>Insert new <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element as child of the
      picture element with <code>src</code>/<code>srcset</code> attribute
      (respectively) equal to the value being set and let it be the
      <em>selected source</em>.
      </li>
      <li>Immediately run the source selection algorithm starting from step 3.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="note">
      These attributes are supposed to behave as similarly to
      <code>Image</code> as possible, specifically setting of <code>src</code>
      should guarantee that source being used. "Run the source selection
      algorithm starting from step 3" ensures that reading of
      <code>src</code>/<code>srcset</code>/<code>width</code>/<code>height</code>
      immediately after setting returns value that was set (rather than old
      value until source selection is re-run later).
    </p>
    <h3>
      Fallback content
    </h3>
    <p>
      User agents may expose fallback content to accessibility tools in one of
      two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>by exposing fallback content as-is, as if the picture element did not
      replace the fallback content. <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements MUST
      NOT be announced.
      </li>
      <li>by presenting fallback content as plain text, as if it was set as
      <code>alt</code> attribute in the controlling image. The plain text
      fallback should be extracted from fallback content using algorithm
      similar to <code>innerText</code>, with additional requirements:
        <ul>
          <li>content of <code>alt</code> attributes of
          <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements in the fallback content MUST be
          included,
          </li>
          <li>content of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and
          <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> descendants must be ignored,
          </li>
          <li>elements that don't represent Phrasing content must imply breaks
          in the text (e.g. imply whitespace before and after the element).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Fallback-as-plaintext is intended to allow integration with existing
      accessibility tools that may support only primitive fallback for images
      due to limitations of <code>&lt;img alt&gt;</code>. Once implementations
      of <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> and accessibility tools mature this
      simplification may be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In interactive visual media with image support enabled user agents SHOULD
      NOT focus elements inside fallback content.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Source selection algorithm
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Schedule run of source selection algorithm" means the algorithm
      described below should be executed no earlier than on the next run of the
      event loop. User agent may choose to delay and coalesce runs of this
      algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent race conditions JavaScript MUST NOT be allowed to mutate DOM
      while this algorithm is being executed, and JavaScript SHOULD NOT be
      allowed to observe source change synchronously (except when
      <code>src</code>/<code>srcset</code> is set by JavaScript explicitly).
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      This may be achieved simply by running the algorithm on the main JS
      thread or before any JS is allowed to run.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>For each <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> child node (in the HTML
      namespace) of the picture element, in tree order:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>If the current source node doesn't have either non-empty
          <code>src</code> or <code>srcset</code> attribute, ignore this source
          and continue evaluating sources.
          </li>
          <li>If the current source node has a non-empty <code>type</code>
          attribute and the type is not supported by the user agent, ignore
          that source and continue evaluating sources.
          </li>
          <li>If the current source node has non-empty <code>media</code>
          attribute:
            <ul>
              <li>If the Media Query contained in the attribute cannot be
              evaluated <em>temporarily</em> (e.g. depends on layout that
              hasn't been done yet) then schedule source selection algorhtm to
              be re-run when the Media Query can be evaluated and abort these
              steps.
              </li>
              <li>If the Media Query does not match, then ignore this source
              and continue evaluating sources.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Use the current source node as the <em>selected source</em>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If no source was selected then continue these steps as if
      <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element with no attributes was the
      <em>selected source</em>.
      </li>
      <li>Copy <code>src</code>, <code>srcset</code>, <code>width</code>, and
      <code>height</code> content attributes (if present) from the <em>selected
      source</em> to the <em>controlling image</em>, or delete them accordingly
      if they're not present on selected source.
      </li>
      <li>Copy <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> content attributes
      (if present) from the picture element to the <em>controlling image</em>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
      Live updates
    </h4>
    <p>
      User agent MUST schedule run of the source selection algorithm when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>children of the picture element are mutated (e.g. insertion/deletion
      of <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements or change of their attributes),
      </li>
      <li>media queries in <code>media</code> attributes of
      <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> children start or cease to match.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      User agents may optimize this and avoid actually running source selection
      algorithm if the change could not possibly affect which source is
      selected (e.g. new <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> was added later in the
      document than the currently selected source).
